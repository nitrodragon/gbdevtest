# Game Boy ROM Development
Probably one of my favorite weekend projects and an all-time bucket list item since I was 12. I can finally say I've built my own Game Boy ROM.

## Minimal Branch
This is the branch in which I'll put as little code as possible into to make it to where it still runs. Will eventually be merged with `full` or probably `master` at some point.
