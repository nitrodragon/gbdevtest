# Game Boy ROM Development
Probably one of my favorite weekend projects and an all-time bucket list item since I was 12. I can finally say I've built my own Game Boy ROM.

## Master vs full
The `master` branch is solely my code, while the `full` branch has eveyrthing you'd need to build and run the projects.

## The Fate of this Project
I'm unsure if I'll be continuing this, but, if I do, I plan on adding maps, collision, better ROM banking (and by that I mean *implementing* ROM banking in the first place), and, of course, a bit of *Thundering Sky* for promo reasons only.
